# React Learning Collection 🧩

This repository is a **personal React learning playground**.

I used this repo to practice React fundamentals while following tutorials and courses.  
It contains multiple small projects, UI experiments, and a few larger practice apps that helped me understand how React works in real code.

This is **not a production-ready portfolio** — it is a learning journey.

## What this repository contains

- **Mini React projects**  
  Small apps like counters, lottery game, Ludo board, todo list, weather UI, pricing cards, etc.  
  These were built to practice:
  - `useState`
  - basic `useEffect`
  - props and component structure
  - handling arrays and objects in state

- **React landing pages & UI practice**  
  Simple landing pages and UI-only components built to get comfortable with layout and styling in React.

- **Full-stack practice projects (MERN-style)**  
  Some folders contain React apps connected to a backend (Node / MongoDB) created while learning how frontend and backend talk to each other.

- **Experiments & refactors**  
  Old code revisited later to fix bugs, update dependencies, or improve state handling.

## Important note (please read)

- Most projects in this repo are **tutorial-based or course-based**.
- I followed videos/articles and then modified the code to understand concepts.
- Code quality is **beginner level** in many places.
- Folder structure and naming may not be consistent across all projects.
- Some projects may be outdated or incomplete — this repo reflects learning over time.

This repo exists to **track learning**, not to show perfection.

## How to run a project (general)

Each project usually lives in its own folder.

Basic steps for most React apps:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What I learned from these projects

- Why React state must be updated immutably (objects & arrays)
- How small components make debugging easier
- Common beginner mistakes with state updates and re-renders
- How React apps grow messy without structure (and why refactoring matters)
- How frontend fits into a full-stack application
Revisiting these projects later helped me clearly see my progress.

## Credits & learning sources

- Many projects were built while learning from tutorials and courses.

Special thanks to:

- Shradha Khapra (Apna College) — for beginner-friendly React explanations
- React official documentation
- MDN Web Docs

If a project is directly based on a tutorial, credits are mentioned inside that project folder when possible.

## Limitations

- Not all apps are responsive
- No production-grade architecture
- No advanced performance optimization
- No security considerations (learning focus only)
